# BetterUI
A simple plugin to help you save time setting up all the ui system again and again.

## How to use it
1. Create your menus from the main `UBetterMenuWidget` class.
2. Create a `UBetterContainerWidget` or use the default one in the content folder of the plugin.
3. Create a subclass from `ABetterHUD` and set up your own widgets and "Back" keys.
